            <p>Modal design was a big part of the work that I did at Zendesk over the summer. There were a lot of people using modals incorrectly in place of the new component I was designing for the design system. </p>
            <p>One of the most important things about designing effective modals is the ability to exit out of it easily. I like how the first article listed all the ways users should be able to exit out of a modal experience.</p>

            <p>After working on design systems and working with WAI-ARIA specifications all summer for my internship, I liked reading this article about proper form design.</p>
            <p>The parts for me that stood out most were about accessibility standards, such as ensuring screen readers could properly read the form aloud and avoiding the use of color to denote an error to avoid issues that could arise with colorblind users. I also resonated with the emphasis on feedback in forms. I think this is especially important in password creation and prefer when the form visually checks off the characters necessary in a password for the site.</p>
            <p>I think the <a href="https://www.theappfuel.com/examples/co-star_onboarding"> Co-Star app</a> does a good job communicating with its users during the onboarding process. The feedback about how the data is used during certain steps of the process that contain sensitive information is a good way to build trust with users.</p>

            <figcaption>Fig. 1 Can Opener </figcaption>
            <p>
                For my studio project, I want to collect images of trash I've found on the street and highlight the reasons I was intrigued by the trash. In this example, I found a can opener on the ground on my way to a bar. I liked that the can opener was closed; I almost couldn't tell what it was at first. I was also confused by its location. It wasn't near any residential buildings; it was on the street outside of Philz. I liked the red and how it stood out against the concrete. This fits in with my project because most of my images feature my shoes and a single random item I found on the street.

            <img src="images/yutaka-housemates.JPG" alt="housemates sitting at the table" width="300">
            <figcaption>Fig. 2 Housemates </figcaption>
            <p>
                Yutaka's image is about all of his friends and housemates. I like the edit of one of his friends on the lamp and how everyone is doing something different in the photo. It's very much a college stressed/fun work session vibe that evokes a lot of familiar feelings. I like seeing what's on the computer screens and the table.

            <p>For my next studio project, I want to explore zooming in on different parts of an image. Since I'll be choosing collages I made over the summer, I want to be able to explore how I can highlight areas of interest within the pieces.</p>
            <p>I looked at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/TwVBLz1qEYemSA">Google Arts and Culture website</a> to see how they displayed photos and art.</p>
            <p>I loved the way the scroll changed the area of the image the user could see. It felt like I was moving through the image, which is the effect I want to have. Since my collages were made in photoshop, maybe I could mimic animations I did on them in AfterEffects with my CSS and JavaScript.</p>

            <p>Modal design was a big part of the work that I did at Zendesk over the summer. There were a lot of people using modals incorrectly in place of the new component I was designing for the design system. </p>
            <p>One of the most important things about designing effective modals is the ability to exit out of it easily. I like how the first article listed all the ways users should be able to exit out of a modal experience.</p>

            <p>After working on design systems and working with WAI-ARIA specifications all summer for my internship, I liked reading this article about proper form design.</p>
            <p>The parts for me that stood out most were about accessibility standards, such as ensuring screen readers could properly read the form aloud and avoiding the use of color to denote an error to avoid issues that could arise with colorblind users. I also resonated with the emphasis on feedback in forms. I think this is especially important in password creation and prefer when the form visually checks off the characters necessary in a password for the site.</p>
            <p>I think the <a href="https://www.theappfuel.com/examples/co-star_onboarding"> Co-Star app</a> does a good job communicating with its users during the onboarding process. The feedback about how the data is used during certain steps of the process that contain sensitive information is a good way to build trust with users.</p>

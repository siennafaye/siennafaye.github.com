        <h1>User Testing Results</h1>
        <p>Through user testing my prototype, I was able to discover 3 main observations.</p>

            <h2>Users faced difficulty when tasked with clicking the second card.</h2>
            <p>
                Because of my layout, the second screen that showed the tarot cards users had to click to reveal, all of my users struggled to locate the second card. The layout pushed the card off the viewport screen, and horizontally scrolling to find it was not intuitive. I’m working on fixing this issue by reformatting the way the images were created in Adobe Illustrator to ensure they have enough space to both fit together on the screen.

            <h2>Users wanted more feedback when they were interacting with clickable items.
            </h2>
            <p>
                There weren’t enough microinteractions on my page to indicate when users could click on items. One of my test subjects suggested more hover interactions, similar to my hover state for my submit button, on items like the cards or close button on the overlay.

        <article>
            <h2>Users wanted a more magical feel to the transitions and interface.
            </h2>
            <p>
                One of my users cited the lack of transitions between screens, card flips, and overlay appearances or disappearances. He said this took away from the topic at hand, which is more mystical and mysterious. I’ll add transitions to maintain the aesthetic of my website and ensure that the animations reflect this as well.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Overall, the user testing feedback I received was very helpful and gave me a sense of direction for finishing up my final project. I resonated with their concerns and saw most of them coming, but was eager to hear ways to improve the overall experience of using my website.

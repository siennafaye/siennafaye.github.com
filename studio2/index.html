                <h1>Trash on the Street!</h1>
                <p>I love trash, especially random trash I find outside. Look at this pancake. Isn't that incredible? I love photographing trash that interests me in some way.</p>

                <h2>The Location</h2>
                <p>I found this pancake outside my apartment on a Saturday morning. I almost missed itâ€”the pancake was tucked underneath a large shrub and hanging off the sidewalk.</p>

                <p>I had so many questions about the location of this pancake.</p>

                <p>How did it get here, under this shrub? Did someone move it off the sidewalk? Or did it fall there?</p>

                <h2>The Sidewalk</h2>
                <p>One of my favorite parts of this pancake is how it hangs off the sidewalk. I wonder if someone moved it off to the side so no one would step on it. Or did it fall out and land that way?</p>

                <p>Still, many questions remain. Why is there only one pancake? Did it fall out of a to-go container? I didn't see a to-go container. Why leave it there, why not throw it in the trash?</p>

                <h2>The Leaf</h2>
                <p>This leaf is incredible. I love how it's just laying on top of the pancake so gently. It's also evidence that the pancake has been sitting there long enough to start to be incorporated into the landscape. How long will it stay there?</p>

                <p>The answer is not very long. I checked back an hour later and the pancake had vanished.</p>

                <h2>Overall</h2>
                <p>This pancake still remains one of my best street trash finds. Everything about it is intriguing and begs for answers to my millions of questions.</p>

                <p>And yet, I'll never get any answers. That's what makes the trash I find so beautiful. It's mysterious, it's ephemeral, it's unique. And I love it.</p>

    <h1>Final Project Brief</h1>

    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I want to update my <a href="studio1/index.html">MadLibs studio project</a> to make it more interactive and more visually appealing for the user. I want it to feel more like receiving an actual tarot reading.
    </p>
    <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>

    <p>
        The first website I looked at for inspiration was the <a href="https://www.werenotreallystrangers.com/">We’re Not Really Strangers website</a>. I love their branding and simple, yet striking interface on their website. They seemed as though they were going in an interactive direction with the cards, but I wish they animated them further. I want to have a similar sleek branding with my design, but include more card animations.

    </p>
    <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>

    <p>
        The second website I looked at was the <a href="https://www.apple.com/wallet/">Wallet section</a> of Apple’s website. I love the scroll animations and how they maintain the card theme throughout the entire experience. It’s very colorful and engaging to look at. Obviously, it’s above my skill level, but I think the micro-animations within the cards could be fun to take inspiration from.

    </p>
    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of my project is to feel like a fun, seamless, and personal experience for the user. I want it to feel magical, similar to how tarot readings can feel. My inspiration from We’re Not Really Strangers is largely their brand and personality. I like how personal their body copy is and how it’s unique to their brand. I want to take inspiration from Apple’s Wallet site’s experience and how seamlessly each topic flows into the next. I also want to maintain a level of visual appeal throughout the design.
    </p>
    <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
    <p>
        I really like my visual themes in my current MadLibs project, so I think I’ll maintain the dark colors, typewriter looking font, and expand on the mysterious and magical feel. I’ll add card illustrations and maybe some smoke effects to add some extra visuals.
    </p>
    <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
    <p>
        The biggest thing I want to add is an animation of the cards entering the screen and flipping over to reveal themselves. I’ll do this with a series of time animations and position changes.
    </p>
    <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
    <p>
        I want the experience to feel automated for the user, as if someone is creating this reading for them, and personal to the user. I’ll do this by including the user inputted data throughout the project and using timed events that’ll trigger automatically.
